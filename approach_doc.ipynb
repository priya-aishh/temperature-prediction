Problem Statement 
Temperature prediction model for a location
Model must be trained from the data of 1 month, compare predicted values against actual values of temperature for the rest 3 months (The R-square value to be compared).

Data 
Now, we need to load the data from csv file using read_csv().

Checking stationarity
We need to check the stationarity of data as this is the assumption of time series model. There are two ways to check the stationarity:
1.	Using Rolling Statistics test

 



2.	Using Dickey-fuller test

 


It is clearly visible that the data is stationary, as in the result of rolling statistics there is very less variations in mean and standard deviation. And from dickey-fuller test we can see that p-value is very less, test-statistics is less than the critical value.



Autocorrelation Function and Partial Autocorrelation Function

1.	Autocorrelation Function

 

2.	Partial Autocorrelation Function

 
Training model
We will train the model using 1 month data and then test the data of rest 3 months. Here, we will choose ARIMA model for training. For thius we need to give three parameters p, d and q. 
In this plot, the two dotted lines on either sides of 0 are the confidence interevals. These can be used to determine the ‘p’ and ‘q’ values as:
1.	p – The lag value where the PACF chart crosses the upper confidence interval for the first time. If you notice closely, in this case p=1.
2.	q – The lag value where the ACF chart crosses the upper confidence interval for the first time. If you notice closely, in this case q=1.


model = ARIMA(history, order=(1,1,0))
model_fit = model.fit(disp=0)
output = model_fit.forecast()



Prediction of data

1.	Training with 1 month data

Mean Squared Error: 0.862
Root Mean Squared Error: 0.928

 



2.	Training with 2 month data

Mean Squared Error: 1.039
Root Mean Squared Error: 1.020
